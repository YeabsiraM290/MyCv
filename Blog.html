            Question 4

        </p>
        <article>
<p><h4>It does matter</h4> <br> In css there are two types of size styling which are absolute and relative styling.
     The absolute styling uses units like px, mm, cm. This styling method gives fixed length. 
    The given property by absolute styling methods stays the same. This is a big trouble because there are a wide variety of sreen size and resolutions. 
    So if make our heading to be nice and big using abosolute styling it may be fine in bigger screens but when viewd on smaller screens it may be too big. 
    And the other disadvantage is our browsers have a way to maximize or minimize font size. So if our styling is absolute there is no way the browsers can affect
that our text.</p>
<p>The other way of styling is relative styling which uses the units like %, em, rem. % means the given style is relative to the parent element.
     em means the given size is relative to current element. and rem means the given size is relative to the root element.</p>

     <p>So lets go back to the issues mentioned before. In relative styling all those problems are gone. 
         Considering screen size relative styling give size to an elemnt relative to the screen size so if we open the site in diffrent screen sized devices 
        both will show th layout of the site is maintained. And the other is browsers zooming, this will not be a problem too what is gona 
        happen is the relative size will adapte the new screen size change and maintain its layout. </p>

        <p>So in my opinion using relative styling matters if we wants to make a site which is not dependent 
            on screen size and can be viwed the same in any device </p>

        Question 6

    </p>
    <article>

<h4>Selectors</h4> 
<p>Originally, CSS allowed the matching of elements by type, class, and/or ID. CSS2.1 added pseudo-elements, pseudo-classes, and combinators. With CSS3, we can target almost any element on the page with a wide range of selectors.
    CSS3 expands upon those attribute selectors.Three more attribute selectors were added in CSS3; they allow for substring selection.</p>
    <p>Matches any element E whose attribute attr starts with the value val. In other words, the val matches the beginning of the attribute value.</p>
    <p>Matches any element E whose attribute attr ends in val. In other words, the val matches the end of the attribute value.</p>
    <p>Matches any element E whose attribute attr matches val anywhere within the attribute. It is similar to E[attr~=val], except the val can be part of a word.</p>

    <h4>Colors</h4> 
<p>CSS3 brings with it support for some new ways of describing colours . 
    Prior to CSS3, before this update almost always color was declared using the hexadecimal format .
    It was also possible to declare colours using the rgb() notation,
     providing either integers (0–255) or percentages.</p>

     <p>The color keyword list has been extended in the CSS3 color module to include 147 additional
          keyword colors (that are generally well supported), CSS3 also provides a number of other options:
          HSL, HSLA, and RGBA. The most notable change with these new color types is the ability to declare semitransparent colors.</p>


          <h4>Border-radius</h4>
          <p>The border-radius property creates rounded corners without the need for images or additional markup. </p>
          
        <p> The border-radius property is actually a shorthand. For our “a” element, the corners are all the same size and symmetrical.
           If we had wanted different-sized corners, we could declare up to four unique values.</p>

           <h4> Drop Shadows </h4>
           <p>CSS3 provides the ability to add drop shadows to elements using the box-shadow property.
                This property lets you specify the color, height, width, blur, 
               and offset of one or multiple inner and/or outer drop shadows on your elements.</p>

               <h4>Multiple background Images</h4> 
            <p> CSS3 provides the ability to add more than one background image to any element, even to pseudo-elements. </p>
